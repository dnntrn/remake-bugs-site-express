  <h2>NYU's Open Source Club</h2>
  <p>
    Open source represents a form of licensing that encourages collaboration and transparency.
    Although open source licenses may take a number of forms, essential features include being able
    to freely study, change, and distribute the source code. BUGS is focused on the promotion of open
    source by engaging students in open source projects on the local and global scale, hosting speakers
    who work with open source in industry and philanthropy, and running events to advocate for open standards
    in subjects such as data and innovation.GS is a member of the Mozilla-led Open Source Student Network
    (OSSN), a network of university students and clubs who share the belief that open source software –
    technology built with code that is open for view, use, and modification – is the engine that powers
    innovation. Mozilla's goal is to support, empower and help Clubs and their members towards getting more
    skills and contributing to Open Source Projects through this network of Clubs.
